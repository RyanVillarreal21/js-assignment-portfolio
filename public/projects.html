      <h3 class="socialTitle">Social Media API</h3>
      <p class="socialBody">
        A RESTful API designed to simulate Twitter. The application allowed the
        user to complete several actions using CRUD operations. The user is able
        to create a new user account to post tweets and follow other users. When
        the user posts a tweet, they can add hashtags and mention other users.
        If needed the user can update or delete their tweets. Other features
        allows the user to either view everyone they are following, the users
        following them, or the feeds of the users they are following.
        Collaborated in a team of three for the API.

      <h3 class="shoppingTitle">Online Shopping System</h3>
      <p class="shoppingBody">
        A GUI designed to emulate an online shopping system. The application
        allowed for three types of users: regular customers, premium customers,
        or suppliers. The customers would be able to select various items before
        viewing their carts and making an order. The customers also have the
        ability to either view any current orders they have or view their entire
        order history. One of the abilities of the supplier is to monitor the
        inventory of the items in the store. The other features of a supplier is
        to monitor the status of orders. The supplier will update the status of
        an order to "Ready" once they have verified the items are in stock.
        Next, the supplier will then update the order to "Shipped" once the
        order has been shipped. Collaborated in a team of four for the
        application.

      <h3 class="logicTitle">Logic Circuit Testing</h3>
      <p class="logicBody">
        A software application designed to test a logic circuits. The user would
        input a boolean expression that would be converted to a logic
        expression. The application would check the circuit for possible
        Stuck-At faults, Equivalent faults, and Collapsed faults. Other features
        currently in progress is checking the logic circuit with Combinational
        Controllability and Combinational Observability.
