      <h2 class="aboutTitle">About Me</h2>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <p class="p1">
          I was born and raised in Corinth, Texas. I graduated from Texas Tech
          University with a major in Computer Engineering and two minors in
          Computer Science and Mathematics.
        </p>
        <p class="p2">
          My curiosity about technology began when I was 10 and I received an
          Xbox 360. I was hooked and drawn in by how the console worked and how
          each video game was developed in comparison to each other.
        </p>
        <p class="p3">
          In high school, I met a teacher who inspired me, and I began taking
          engineering classes. I began to learn how to build circuits, create
          software applications, and design 3D models using SolidWorks. One of
          the software programs I built was a simple Pong game using a Raspberry
          Pi.
        </p>
        <p class="p4">
          During my time in college, I continued to expand my knowledge in
          electronics and software development through various assignments and
          projects. A project that has a big impact on me was an online shopping
          system designed in Java when I was in an Object-Oriented Programming
          course. I found that I really enjoyed the process of creating the
          different methods in the the application, and I began to learn about
          databases, software engineering, python, and C++.
        </p>
        <p class="p5">
          I am currently a part of the FastTrack program that is helping me
          expand my knowledge in full-stack development using Java, Spring Boot,
          PostgreSQL, Javascript, HTML, and CSS.
        </p>
        <p class="p6">
          When I am not working, I like to spend time with friends and family
          watching movies, playing games, or reading. I also enjoy volunteering
          in my community. I volunteer with my church and a soup-kitchen.
